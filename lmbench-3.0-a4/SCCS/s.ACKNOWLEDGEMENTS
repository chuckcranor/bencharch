LMbench was originally developed by Larry McVoy while he worked
at Sun Microsystems.  Larry continued development while working
at Silicon Graphics, and was joined by Carl Staelin, who works
for Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.

LMbench would not be the successful cross-platform benchmark
that it is today without the efforts and assistance of a wide
range of people.  From volunteers who run it on various hardware
and report bugs, to managers who provide financial and other
support, to peers and colleagues who request features or
provide feedback on design elements.  All such help has been
critical to making LMbench a success.

Below is a partial list of all those people who helped support
the development of LMbench in one form or other, such as
benchmark suggestions, bug reports, and so forth.  All omissions
are accidental, and if your name was not included, please accept
our humble apologies.
